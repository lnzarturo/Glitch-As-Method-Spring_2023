      Get ready to experience a disruptive and kinetic real-time multimedia performance, as University students from VCU Arts in Richmond, Virginia present SUM DIMENSION. This hour and a half performance, created by the collective minds of Professor HOLLOWAY's Glitch-As-Method class, will have you recalculating your expectations of art making. Using the frameworks of glitch and feminist theory, this round-robin performance explores the function of distortion and chaos, all while showcasing a decayed and modified plethora of electronics. Don't miss your chance to witness this abstract and thought-provoking display of artistic expression; peeling back the layers you get, like, a Slinky and then it's elongated so the surface area is more cus you've extended it but they don't really know what you do with after that. Come find out. <br><br>

    Diego Gomez is a primarily digital artist who works with video, animation, photography and 3D.<br><br>
    Growing up the youngest in an immigrant family, he combines the foreign values instilled in him with the domestic ones to criticize the more ridiculous aspects of American culture that largely go unnoticed. Most notably the protest of the standard of the digital art needing to be crisp and Hi-Def to be legitimate, finding beauty and meaning in the rustic quality of “outdated” technology, fostered by growing up in a family that was always 2-3 generations behind the current standard but managing perfectly well despite that, as well as being the recipient of many hand-me-downs. <br> <br> Many of his works deal with urban environments and use of sounds and light to immerse the viewer into a looming yet beautiful world.

 <h4>	Rose Khoury </h4>
      Motivated by a longing for a bearable collective existence, the work I create approaches the overwhelming nature of what is a no longer hypothetical future. Trying to encounter understanding through the confusion of interpersonal relationships, my drawings address loneliness, longing, the joyous vulnerability that intimacy offers, the teetering confusion and insecurity that erotic relations inevitably invite. Ideas about a permissible existence appear within my work primarily in terms of how I address restraint and degradation as it relates to our environment and the body. I’m attempting to recontextualize a preoccupation with control, tasking myself with intentional cultivation. In defiance of deterioration maturation manifests through such somatic modifications as transgender deformation and handpoke tattoo as an attempt to heal/guard the body and psyche. Through material research in fermentation, discard, and utility, the presence of permission extends as the need to create work that addresses concerns of physical/ecological consumption; allowing my work to rot, regenerate, and reanimate. The literal growth and decay is intimately interwoven with the cultivation of self I'm encountering, recognizing my work as an extension and attempted understanding of new life, new embodiment.
