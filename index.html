      Get ready to experience a disruptive and kinetic real-time multimedia performance, as University students from VCU Arts in Richmond, Virginia present SUM DIMENSION. This hour and a half performance, created by the collective minds of Professor HOLLOWAY's Glitch-As-Method class, will have you recalculating your expectations of art making. Using the frameworks of glitch and feminist theory, this round-robin performance explores the function of distortion and chaos, all while showcasing a decayed and modified plethora of electronics. Don't miss your chance to witness this abstract and thought-provoking display of artistic expression; peeling back the layers you get, like, a Slinky and then it's elongated so the surface area is more cus you've extended it but they don't really know what you do with after that. Come find out. <br><br>

     <b>The Things We Hold Deer</b> is a paper-mache deer head mounted atop a cardboard box. The audience is encouraged to whisper secrets into its ear-tubes, just to the deer or to a companion on the other side. On the paper provided, the audience is encouraged to write secrets and "feed" the deer, putting their hand in its maw and dropping the paper down it's throat, where it will be destroyed in a bowl of water laying below.

The piece speaks on the artist's OCD and how they deal with their worst and most troubling intrusive thoughts.

Links between sculptural and digital fabrications are orchestrated by code, creative electronics, and human touch. Audiences are challenged to meet the piece with unconditional care and empathy for the innocent and unwittingly grotesque, or else succumb to complacency and discomfort.

<b>DO NOT RESUSCITATE</b> is a screen dance performance tribute to the text, ‘DO NOT RESUSCITATE.’ Written by Alyssa Scinta for the Kinetic Imaging Glitch as Method course, this piece brings the concept of deleted or corrupted technological art to life. With the program of the piece designing to override, it is impossible for the artist to recreate a duplicate frame again. The first component of the piece is the artist herself. Scinta uses the shape and color of her facial features as the paintbrush. The next includes the canvas, which is compiled of an image instancing sequence programmed in Touch Designer. This interface causes the shape of her features mold an abstract image that is constantly evolving through immediate time.

We spend too much time trying to conceive art that has some higher purpose than ourselves, instead of creating something just for the sake of creating. This piece will be a concave of moving particles and images synced to Ableton Live.
